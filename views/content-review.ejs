    <h3>Target Grade Level 6-12
      <br>Target Audience:
    </h3>

    <h3>Overview of Basic Information</h3>
    <p>Language Tree Online is cloud-based, so there’s no software for teachers or students to download. However, users
      will need to be rostered in the program and grouped in the appropriate class. Teachers can self-add students to
      the class roster or we can roster automatically if the school/district has ClassLink or Clever.
      To access the program, students and teachers can login with provided credentials or go through the district’s
      ClassLink or Clever portal.
      We recommend that educators read the “Getting Started” Guide and attend the live 1-hour onboarding session. In
      this training, we will review the program components, go over the platform’s user interface and recommend
      best-practices on how to use it in the context of your class.
